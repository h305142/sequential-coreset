## Ridge

>the next two python files are to solve the Ridge regression.
------
Coreset_Ridge.py

Ridge_baseline.py

-------

>Coreset_Ridge includes the algorithms of Sequential Coreset, Uniform, OneShot, ImpSamp. This file also
consider the construction of synthetic dataset and measurement. It mainly consider the result of different coreset size.

>Ridge_baseline.py concludes the algorithms of Sequential Coreset, Uniform, OneShot, ImpSamp and AccuCore.
It mainly consider the result of construction different datasets with different dimension.

## Lasso

Coreset_Lasso.py

Lasso_baseline.py

-------

>Coreset_Lasso includes the algorithms of Sequential Coreset, Uniform, OneShot, ImpSamp. This file also
considers the construction of synthetic dataset and measurement. It  considers the result of different coreset size.

>Lasso_baseline.py concludes the algorithms of Sequential Coreset, Uniform, OneShot, ImpSamp and AccuCore.
It  considers the result of construction different datasets with different dimension.

## Logistic

Booster.py
Other python files
-------

>Booster.py is the original codes of AccuCore("Fast and Accurate Least-Mean-Squares Solvers")
>The rest python files are original codes of ImpSample("Coresets for Near-Convex Functions")



## Gaussian Mixture Model

> The gmm part is based on the implementation from https://github.com/zalanborsos/coresets
>
> We continue to expand on this basis, adding our sequential coreset technique in the Mixture file folder.
